                <b>The Core Ideas Of Economics</b>
                <p>
                    All economic questions occur since <span class="key">we want more than we can get</span>.<br>
                    For example, we want more time than we can have.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Scarcity</span>: our inability to satisfy all our wants<br>
                    <br>
                    We must make <span class="key">choices</span> since we face scarcity.<br>
                    The choices we make depend on the incentives we face.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Incentive</span>: a reward that encourages an action or a penalty that discourages an action<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>Standard Definition of Economics</b>

                        <span class="key">Economics</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                the social science that studies the <span class="key">choices</span> that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with <span class="key">scarcity</span> and the <span class="key">incentives</span> that influence and reconcile those choice

                                divides in to two main parts:

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Example: Why are people buying more e-books and fewer hard copy books?

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When do choices made in the pursuit of <span class="key">self-interest</span> also promote the <span class="key">social interest</span>?
                    </li>
                </ol>    
                <br>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Goods</span>: physical objects such as laptops and cellphones<br>

                    <br>
                    <span class="key">What?</span><br>
                    <i>What</i> we produce varies across countries and changes over time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">How?</span><br>
                    <i>How</i> we produce is described by the technologies and resources that we use.<br>
                    Goods and services are produced by using productive resources that economists call <span class="key">factors of production</span>.<br> 
                    <br>
                    Factors of production are grouped into four categories:<br>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Labour</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the work time and work effort that people devote to producing goods and services</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Capital</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                the tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other constructions that businesses use to produce goods and services
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                the knowledge and skill that people obtain from education, on-the-job training, and work experience are called <span class="key">human capital</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                money, stocks, and bonds are called <span class="key">financial cpaital</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="key">Entrepreneurship</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the human resource that organizes land, labour and capital</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Since capital includes most of the things, it may be easy to mess up with land.<br>
                    For example, forest is a land but if we cut down the tree, the wood we get is a capital.<br>
                    The oil beneath the Earth's surface is land, and if we recovered the oil, it is capital.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example: Your neighbour has a bakery<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Land: power, raw materials for making bread (flour, salt, water...)</li>
                    <li>Labour: the people who work in the bakery</li>
                    <li>Capital: the bakery, bread maker</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurship: Your neighbour's skills at leading the bakery</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">For Whom?</span><br>
                    <i>Who</i> gets the goods and services depends on the incomes that people earn.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Land earns <span class="key">rent</span>.</li>
                    <li>Labour earns <span class="key">wages</span>.</li>
                    <li>Capital earns <span class="key">interest</span>.</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurship earns <span class="key">profit</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Notice that interest is always with percentage, but rent, wages and profit are with money.<br>

                <b>Two Big Economic Questions</b>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Can the pursuit of self-interest promote the social interest?</span><br>
                    People need to make economic choices that result in <span class="key">what</span>, <span class="key">how</span> and <span class="key">for whom</span> goods and services are produced every day.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do we produce the right things in the right quantities?</li>
                    <li>Do we use our factors of production in the best way?</li>
                    <li>Do the goods and services go to those who should get them?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Self-Interest</span>: the choice is the best one available for you<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Social Interest</span>: the choice is the best for society as a whole<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Efficient</span>: it in is <i>not</i> possible to make someone better without making some else worse, then the resource use is efficient; otherwise, not efficient<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Expropriation of Private Property</span><br>
                    This happens when the government takes private property for public purpose.<br>
                    For example, the government wants to take the private land for building a road.<br>
                    The land owner will get "compensated", but not as much as he/she would like to have.<br>
                    The government will offer the market price for buying the land from the owner.<br>
                    However, the owner may not want to sell the land; he/she may want more that the market price.<br>
                    Of course, the owner may have his/her own personal reason for not selling the land.<br>
                    The government may force to take the land because of social interest.<br>
                    Is this fair? Is it in the social interest?<br>
                    This is why not everyone agree with all social interest.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is hard to answer the questions about the social interest. Today, social interest forces on four different issues:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="key">Globalizaion</span>: the expansion of international trade, borrowing and lending, and investment</li>
                    <li><span class="key">Information-Age Monopolie</span>: the technological change of the past 40 years has been called the <i>Information Revoluion</i></li>
                    <li><span class="key">Climate Change</span></li>
                    <li><span class="key">Economic Instability</span></li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <b>The Economic Way of Thinking</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>a choice is a <span class="key">tradeoff</span></li>
                    <li>people make <span class="key">rational choices (or "purposeful")</span> by comparing benefits and costs</li>
                    <li><span class="key">benefit</span> is what you gain from something</li>
                    <li><span class="key">cost</span> is what you must give up to get something</li>
                    <li>most choices are "how much" choices made at the <span class="key">margin</span></li>
                    <li>choices respond to <span class="key">incentives</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People will make the choice which is better of themselves, but not for the society.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>Thinking about Our Actions as Choices</b>
                <p>
                    Example: Going to university for 4+ years as a choice<br>
                    <br>
                    What will we give up?<br> Time, the salary we can get from a job, ...<br>
                    These are our opportunity cost.<br>
                    <br>
                    What do we expect benefits?<br> Knowledges, a better salary after graduation, ...<br>
                    These are our expected benefits.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Opportunity Cost</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the highest-valued alternative that must be given up for getting something</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Rational Choice</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>it compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice</li>
                            <li>it does NOT mean smart choice</li>
                            <li>it is the choice that makes people feel good</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Only the wants of the person making a choice are relevant to determine its rationality.<br>
                    <br>
                    Question: <span class="key">What</span> goods and services will be produced and in what quantities?<br>
                    Answer: Those that people rationally choice to buy!<br>

                <b>Economics: A Social Science and Policy Tool</b>
                <p>
                    Economists are the social scientists; they distinguish between two types of statements:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Positive Statements: What <span class="key">is</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>can be tested by checking it against facts</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Normative Statements: What <span class="key">ought to be</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>expresses an opinion and cannot be tested</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Understand the Cause and the Effect</span><br>
                    The task of economic science is to discover positive statements that are consistent with what we observe in the world and that enable us to understand how the economic world works.<br>
                    Economists create and test <span class="key">economic models</span>.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Economic Model</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a description of some aspect of the economic world that includes only those features that are needed for the purpose at hand</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Economists are also the policy advisors.<br>
                    Economics is a set of tools for advising governments, businesses and for making personal decisions.<br>
                    All the policy questions on which economists provide advice involve a blend of the positive and the normative.<br>
                    Economics can't help with the normative part (the goal).<br>
                    But for a given goal, economics provides a method of evaluating alternative solutions — comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.<br>

                    In election campaigns, candidates often make a lot of promises, which people want to have/change.<br>
                    For example, more and better health care, better roads/bridges/sewer systems, better education, etc.<br>
                    <br>
                    The concept of <span class="key">Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)</span> helps us to understand why these promises are unrealistic.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>The Story behind the Production Possibilities Frontier</b>
                <p>
                    There is a limited amount of factors of production (land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship) in an economy anytime.<br>
                    For example, time is limited - you may focus on one course and get a high mark, but the other courses will not do well.<br>
                    <br>
                    The factors of production can be employed to produce goods and services that people want.<br>
                    For example, we think more pizza should be produced in Canada.<br>
                    Thus, we need to employ more factors of production in the production of pizza.<br>
                    That is, more land for pizza restaurants, more people to build new restaurants, more machines, more backers, etc.<br>
                    But we cannot create something out of nothing, the additional resources will have to come from other places.<br>
                    Assume there are only two industries: pizza and cola.<br>
                    Then the additional resources will come from the production of cola.<br>
                    <br>
                    The figure below shows the production possibilities frontier for two goods: cola and pizza.<br>

                    <br>
                    The firm's goal is to maximise profit.<br>
                    If the firm fails to maximise its profit, it is either eliminated or taken over by another firm that seeks to maximise profit.<br>
                    <br>
                    An alternative formulation of firm's goal is to make profit and avoid loss.<br>
                    Notice that profit maximisation is not required in here.<br>

                <b>Technology and Economic Efficiency</b>
                <p class="keyword">Technology Efficiency</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>occurs when a firm uses the least amount inputs to produce a given quantity of output</li>
                    <li>different combinations of inputs might be used to produce a given good</li>
                    <li>if it is impossible to produce a given good by decreasing any one input (and all other inputs constant), then production is technologically efficient</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="keyword">Economic Efficiency</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>occurs when the firm produces a given quantity of output at the least cost</li>
                    <li>economically efficient method depends on the relative costs of capital and labour</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    What is the different between technology efficiency and economic efficiency?<br>
                    Technology efficiency cares about the quantity of inputs used in production for a given quantity of output.<br>
                    However, economic efficiency cares about the cost of inputs used.<br>
                    <br>
                    Notice that an economically efficient production process also is technologically efficient.<br>
                    But an technologically efficient process may not be economically efficient.<br>
                    Also, technologically inefficient method is never economically efficient.<br>
                    <br>
                    Changes in the input prices influence the value of the inputs, but not the technological process for using them in production.<br>

                <b>Information and Organisation</b>
                <p>
                    A firm organises production by combining and coordinating productive resources using a mixture of two systems:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>a method of organising production that uses a managerial hierarchy</li>
                            <li>commands pass downward through the hierarchy and information (feedback) passes upward</li>
                            <li>are relatively rigid and can have many layers of specialised management</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Incentive Systems</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a method of organising production that uses a market-like mechanism to induce workers to perform in ways that maximise the firm's profit</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Most firms use a mix of command and incentive systems to maximise profit.<br>
                    Firms use command systems when it is easy to monitor performance or when a small deviation from the ideal performance is very costly.<br>
                    Firms use incentive systems whenever monitoring performance is impossible or too costly to be worth doing.<br>

                    The problem of devising compensation rules that induce an <u>agent</u> to act in the best interest of a <u>principal</u>.<br>
                    For example, the stockholders of a firm are the <u>principals</u> and the firm's managers are <u>agents</u>; the stockholders must induce managers to act in the stockholders' best interest.<br>

                <p>
                    A principal must create incentives that induce each agent to work in the interests of the principal. The are 3 ways of coping with the principal-agent problem:
                </p>
                <ul>

                            <li>often offered to managers, gives the managers an incentive to maximise the firm's profits, which is the goal of the owners, the principals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Incentive Pay</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>links managers' or workers' pay to the firm's performance and helps align the managers' and workers' interests with those of the owners, the principals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>can tie managers' or workers' long-term rewards to the long-term performance of the firm</li>
                            <li>this arrangement encourages the agents work in the best long-term interests of the firm owners, the principals</li>

                <p>Economists identify four market types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Perfect Competition</span>
                        <ul>

                            <li>many firms and buyers are well-informed about the prices of the products of each firm in the industry</li>

                    Firms coordinate production when a task can be performed more efficiently by a firm than by market.<br>

                <b>Transactions Costs</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>the costs arising from finding someone with whom to do business, reaching agreement on the price and other aspects of the exchange, and ensuring that the terms of the agreement are fulfilled</li>

<!--
	<b>Decision Time Frames</b>
	<p>
		The actions that a firm can take to influence the relationship between output and cost depend on how soon the firm wants to act.<br>
		<br>
		To study the relationship between a firm's output decision and its costs, we differentiate between two decision time frames:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the Short Run</li>
		<li>the Long Run</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<b>the Short Run</b>
	<ul>
		<li>a time frame in which the quantity of one or more resources used in production is fixed</li>
		<li>
			for most firms, capital, land and entrepreneurship are fixed factors of production, and labour is the variable factor of production
			<ul>
				<li>firm's <span class="keyword">Plant</span>: the fixed factors of production; in short-run, it is fixed</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>to increase output in short run, a firm must increase the quantity of a variable factor of production (usually labour)</li>
		<li>
			short-run decisions are easily reversed
			<ul>
				<li>the firm can increase/decrease its output in the short run by changing the amount of labour it hires</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<b>the Long Run</b>
	<ul>
		<li>a time frame in which the quantities of <u>all</u> resources (including the plant size) can be varied</li>
		<li>to increase output in long run, a firm can change its plant as well as the quantity of labour it hires</li>
		<li>
			long-run decisions are <u>not</u> easily reversed
			<ul>
				<li>once a plant decision is made, the firm usually must live with it for some time</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="keyword">Sunk Cost</span>: a cost incurred by the firm and cannot be changed
			<ul>
				<li>sunk costs are irrelevant to a firm's current decisions</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>if a firm's plant has no resale value, the amount paid for it is a sunk cost</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<b>Short-Run Technology Constraint</b>
	<ul>
		<li>to increase output in short run, a firm must increase the amount of labour employed</li>
		<li>three concepts describe the relationship between output and the quantity of labour employed:</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Total Product</li>
		<li>Marginal Product</li>
		<li>Average Product</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>Product Schedules</b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span> Total Product</span>: the total output produced in a given period
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Marginal Product</span> of Labour: the change in total product that results from a one-unit increase in the quantity of labour employed, with all other inputs remaining the same
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Average Product</span> of Labour = Total Product &div; Quantity of Labour Employed
		</li>
	</ul>
