                <b>The Core Ideas Of Economics</b>
                <p>
                    All economic questions occur since <span class="key">we want more than we can get</span>.<br>
                    For example, we want more time than we can have.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Scarcity</span>: our inability to satisfy all our wants<br>
                    <br>
                    We must make <span class="key">choices</span> since we face scarcity.<br>
                    The choices we make depend on the incentives we face.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Incentive</span>: a reward that encourages an action or a penalty that discourages an action<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>Standard Definition of Economics</b>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                the social science that studies the <span class="key">choices</span> that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with <span class="key">scarcity</span> and the <span class="key">incentives</span> that influence and reconcile those choice

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Example: Why are people buying more e-books and fewer hard copy books?

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When do choices made in the pursuit of <span class="key">self-interest</span> also promote the <span class="key">social interest</span>?

                </ol>    
                <br>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Goods</span>: physical objects such as laptops and cellphones<br>

                    <br>
                    <span class="key">What?</span><br>
                    <i>What</i> we produce varies across countries and changes over time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">How?</span><br>
                    <i>How</i> we produce is described by the technologies and resources that we use.<br>
                    Goods and services are produced by using productive resources that economists call <span class="key">factors of production</span>.<br> 
                    <br>
                    Factors of production are grouped into four categories:<br>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Labour</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the work time and work effort that people devote to producing goods and services</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Capital</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                the tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other constructions that businesses use to produce goods and services
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                the knowledge and skill that people obtain from education, on-the-job training, and work experience are called <span class="key">human capital</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                money, stocks, and bonds are called <span class="key">financial cpaital</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="key">Entrepreneurship</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the human resource that organizes land, labour and capital</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Since capital includes most of the things, it may be easy to mess up with land.<br>
                    For example, forest is a land but if we cut down the tree, the wood we get is a capital.<br>
                    The oil beneath the Earth's surface is land, and if we recovered the oil, it is capital.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example: Your neighbour has a bakery<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Land: power, raw materials for making bread (flour, salt, water...)</li>
                    <li>Labour: the people who work in the bakery</li>
                    <li>Capital: the bakery, bread maker</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurship: Your neighbour's skills at leading the bakery</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">For Whom?</span><br>
                    <i>Who</i> gets the goods and services depends on the incomes that people earn.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Land earns <span class="key">rent</span>.</li>
                    <li>Labour earns <span class="key">wages</span>.</li>
                    <li>Capital earns <span class="key">interest</span>.</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurship earns <span class="key">profit</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Notice that interest is always with percentage, but rent, wages and profit are with money.<br>

                <b>Two Big Economic Questions</b>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Can the pursuit of self-interest promote the social interest?</span><br>
                    People need to make economic choices that result in <span class="key">what</span>, <span class="key">how</span> and <span class="key">for whom</span> goods and services are produced every day.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do we produce the right things in the right quantities?</li>
                    <li>Do we use our factors of production in the best way?</li>
                    <li>Do the goods and services go to those who should get them?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Self-Interest</span>: the choice is the best one available for you<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Social Interest</span>: the choice is the best for society as a whole<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Efficient</span>: it in is <i>not</i> possible to make someone better without making some else worse, then the resource use is efficient; otherwise, not efficient<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="key">Expropriation of Private Property</span><br>
                    This happens when the government takes private property for public purpose.<br>
                    For example, the government wants to take the private land for building a road.<br>
                    The land owner will get "compensated", but not as much as he/she would like to have.<br>
                    The government will offer the market price for buying the land from the owner.<br>
                    However, the owner may not want to sell the land; he/she may want more that the market price.<br>
                    Of course, the owner may have his/her own personal reason for not selling the land.<br>
                    The government may force to take the land because of social interest.<br>
                    Is this fair? Is it in the social interest?<br>
                    This is why not everyone agree with all social interest.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is hard to answer the questions about the social interest. Today, social interest forces on four different issues:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="key">Globalizaion</span>: the expansion of international trade, borrowing and lending, and investment</li>
                    <li><span class="key">Information-Age Monopolie</span>: the technological change of the past 40 years has been called the <i>Information Revoluion</i></li>
                    <li><span class="key">Climate Change</span></li>
                    <li><span class="key">Economic Instability</span></li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <b>The Economic Way of Thinking</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>a choice is a <span class="key">tradeoff</span></li>
                    <li>people make <span class="key">rational choices (or "purposeful")</span> by comparing benefits and costs</li>
                    <li><span class="key">benefit</span> is what you gain from something</li>
                    <li><span class="key">cost</span> is what you must give up to get something</li>
                    <li>most choices are "how much" choices made at the <span class="key">margin</span></li>
                    <li>choices respond to <span class="key">incentives</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People will make the choice which is better of themselves, but not for the society.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>Thinking about Our Actions as Choices</b>
                <p>
                    Example: Going to university for 4+ years as a choice<br>
                    <br>
                    What will we give up?<br> Time, the salary we can get from a job, ...<br>
                    These are our opportunity cost.<br>
                    <br>
                    What do we expect benefits?<br> Knowledges, a better salary after graduation, ...<br>
                    These are our expected benefits.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Opportunity Cost</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the highest-valued alternative that must be given up for getting something</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Rational Choice</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>it compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice</li>
                            <li>it does NOT mean smart choice</li>
                            <li>it is the choice that makes people feel good</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Only the wants of the person making a choice are relevant to determine its rationality.<br>
                    <br>
                    Question: <span class="key">What</span> goods and services will be produced and in what quantities?<br>
                    Answer: Those that people rationally choice to buy!<br>

                <b>Economics: A Social Science and Policy Tool</b>
                <p>
                    Economists are the social scientists; they distinguish between two types of statements:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Positive Statements: What <span class="key">is</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>can be tested by checking it against facts</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Normative Statements: What <span class="key">ought to be</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>expresses an opinion and cannot be tested</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <span class="key">Understand the Cause and the Effect</span><br>
                    The task of economic science is to discover positive statements that are consistent with what we observe in the world and that enable us to understand how the economic world works.<br>
                    Economists create and test <span class="key">economic models</span>.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key">Economic Model</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a description of some aspect of the economic world that includes only those features that are needed for the purpose at hand</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Economists are also the policy advisors.<br>
                    Economics is a set of tools for advising governments, businesses and for making personal decisions.<br>
                    All the policy questions on which economists provide advice involve a blend of the positive and the normative.<br>
                    Economics can't help with the normative part (the goal).<br>
                    But for a given goal, economics provides a method of evaluating alternative solutions — comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.<br>

                    In election campaigns, candidates often make a lot of promises, which people want to have/change.<br>
                    For example, more and better health care, better roads/bridges/sewer systems, better education, etc.<br>
                    <br>
                    The concept of <span class="key">Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)</span> helps us to understand why these promises are unrealistic.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>The Story behind the Production Possibilities Frontier</b>
                <p>
                    There is a limited amount of factors of production (land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship) in an economy anytime.<br>
                    For example, time is limited - you may focus on one course and get a high mark, but the other courses will not do well.<br>
                    <br>
                    The factors of production can be employed to produce goods and services that people want.<br>
                    For example, we think more pizza should be produced in Canada.<br>
                    Thus, we need to employ more factors of production in the production of pizza.<br>
                    That is, more land for pizza restaurants, more people to build new restaurants, more machines, more backers, etc.<br>
                    But we cannot create something out of nothing, the additional resources will have to come from other places.<br>
                    Assume there are only two industries: pizza and cola.<br>
                    Then the additional resources will come from the production of cola.<br>
                    <br>
                    The figure below shows the production possibilities frontier for two goods: cola and pizza.<br>

                    Most of the firms do not make the things they sell.<br>
                    For example, Apple does not make iPhone.<br>

                    Questions:<br>
                    How do firms decide what to make themselves and what to buy from other firms?<br>
                    How do the millions of firms around the world make their business decisions?<br>

                <b>The Firm and Its Economic Problem</b>
                <p>
                    <span class="keyword">Firm</span> is an institution that hires factors of production and organises them to produce or sell goods and services.<br>
                    <br>
                    The firm's goal is to maximise profit.<br>
                    If the firm fails to maximise its profit, it is either eliminated or taken over by another firm that seeks to maximise profit.<br>
                    <br>
                    An alternative formulation of firm's goal is to make profit and avoid loss.<br>
                    Notice that profit maximisation is not required in here.<br>

                    <span class="keyword">Economic Accounting</span>: <span class="math">Economic Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost</span><br>
                    Here, the total cost is measured as the opportunity cost of production.<br>
                    <br>
                    The opportunity cost of any action is the highest-valued alternative forgone.<br>
                    A <span class="keyword">firm's opportunity cost of production</span> is the value of the best alternative use of the resources that a firm uses in production.<br>
                    It is the sum of the cost of using resources:

                <b>Technology and Economic Efficiency</b>
                <p class="keyword">Technology Efficiency</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>occurs when a firm uses the least amount inputs to produce a given quantity of output</li>
                    <li>different combinations of inputs might be used to produce a given good</li>
                    <li>if it is impossible to produce a given good by decreasing any one input (and all other inputs constant), then production is technologically efficient</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="keyword">Economic Efficiency</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>occurs when the firm produces a given quantity of output at the least cost</li>
                    <li>economically efficient method depends on the relative costs of capital and labour</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    What is the different between technology efficiency and economic efficiency?<br>
                    Technology efficiency cares about the quantity of inputs used in production for a given quantity of output.<br>
                    However, economic efficiency cares about the cost of inputs used.<br>
                    <br>
                    Notice that an economically efficient production process also is technologically efficient.<br>
                    But an technologically efficient process may not be economically efficient.<br>
                    Also, technologically inefficient method is never economically efficient.<br>
                    <br>
                    Changes in the input prices influence the value of the inputs, but not the technological process for using them in production.<br>

                <b>Information and Organisation</b>
                <p>
                    A firm organises production by combining and coordinating productive resources using a mixture of two systems:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Command Systems</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a method of organising production that uses a managerial hierarchy</li>
                            <li>commands pass downward through the hierarchy and information (feedback) passes upward</li>
                            <li>are relatively rigid and can have many layers of specialised management</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Incentive Systems</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a method of organising production that uses a market-like mechanism to induce workers to perform in ways that maximise the firm's profit</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Most firms use a mix of command and incentive systems to maximise profit.<br>
                    Firms use command systems when it is easy to monitor performance or when a small deviation from the ideal performance is very costly.<br>
                    Firms use incentive systems whenever monitoring performance is impossible or too costly to be worth doing.<br>

                    For example, the stockholders of a firm are the <u>principals</u> and the firm's managers are <u>agents</u>; the stockholders must induce managers to act in the stockholders' best interest.<br>

                <b>Coping with the Principal-Agent Problem</b>
                <p>
                    A principal must create incentives that induce each agent to work in the interests of the principal. The are 3 ways of coping with the principal-agent problem:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Ownership</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>often offered to managers, gives the managers an incentive to maximise the firm's profits, which is the goal of the owners, the principals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Incentive Pay</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>links managers' or workers' pay to the firm's performance and helps align the managers' and workers' interests with those of the owners, the principals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Long-Term Contacts</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>can tie managers' or workers' long-term rewards to the long-term performance of the firm</li>
                            <li>this arrangement encourages the agents work in the best long-term interests of the firm owners, the principals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These three ways of coping with the principal-agent problem give rise to different types of business organisation.<br></p>
                <br>
                <b>Three Main Types of Business Organisation</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <span class="keyword">Sole Proprietorship</span>

                            <li>
                                a firm with a single owner (a proprietor) who has unlimited liability
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="keyword">Unlimited Liability</span>: the legal responsibility for all the debts incurred by the firm up to an amount equal to the entire wealth of the owner</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>example: farmers, programmers and artists often operate as sole proprietorships</li>
                            <li>proprietor also makes management decisions and receives the firm's profit, is responsible for its loss</li>
                            <li>profits from a sole proprietorship are taxed the same as the owner's other income</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                                profits from partnerships are taxed as the personal income of the owners
                                <ul>
                                    <li>but each partner is legally responsible for all the debts of the partnership</li>

                <p>
                    Firms coordinate production when a task can be performed more efficiently by a firm than by market.<br>

                <ol>
                    <li>low transactions costs</li>

                <br>
                <b>Transactions Costs</b>
                <ul>
