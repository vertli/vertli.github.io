                <h3>I'm Calvin, and...</h3>
                <p>I'm currently a Computational Mathematics student at University of Waterloo. I'm passionately interested in programming and I actively try my best to improve my skills.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>I love games, and...</h3>
                <p>I create games. I have started making RPG board games since I was in primary school. After I leant how to code with Pascal, I started creating storytelling text games. In the future, I would like to transfer my RPG board games to video games (in 2D, of course).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>I do arts. For me...</h3>
                <p>Arts is the perfect way to represent my own feeling. I enjoy doing arts. However, I hate dirty. Thus I usually just draw with colour pencils and markers. (Usless I have to do my school projects, then I will try ohter media.)</p>
                <br>
                <h3>I'm not only a programmer, a gamer and an artist...</h3>
                <p>I'm also a dart player. Dart is the only sport I fall in love with. I do know how to play badminton, but not that good. One interesting fact is that I don't know how to play table tennis but I was in my Hong Kong secondary school team. I was the only judge in my school.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Lastly...</h3>
                <p>I love listening music. My favourite singing groups are Celtic Thunder and Celtic Woman. I also like the sound of violin. Sadly, I don't know how to play violn.</p>
